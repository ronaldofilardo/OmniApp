  - files.service: 11/11
  - files.behavior: 9/9
  - sharing.behavior: 4/4
  - conflicts: 2/2
  - professionals: 2/2
  - repository: 2/2
  - repository.service: 1/1
  - sharing: 2/2
  - debug: 2/2
  - files: 2/2
  - backup: 2/2

- **Middleware**: 3/3 (100%)

  - requireUserEmail: 3/3

- **External Router**: 4/7 (57%)

  - ✅ should return 404 for non-existent user
  - ✅ should return 400 for invalid data
  - ✅ should return 400 for non-image file
  - ✅ should return 400 for file too large

- **Integration**: 5/10 (50%)
  - ✅ GET /events/:eventId/files - empty array
  - ✅ POST /events/:eventId/files - reject without type
  - ✅ POST /events/:eventId/files - reject without file
  - ✅ GET /files/:fileId/view - 404 for non-existent
  - ✅ DELETE /files/:fileId - 404 for non-existent

### ❌ **Failing** (16 tests)

#### external.router.test.ts (3 failures)

1. ❌ should create event and files successfully

   - **Error**: Foreign key violation on professionals.create
   - **Status**: 500 (expected 201)

2. ❌ should handle multiple file uploads

   - **Error**: No events created (expected 1)
   - **Likely cause**: Same as #1

3. ❌ should update existing event when same user, professional and date
   - **Error**: Foreign key violation on events.create in test setup
   - **Likely cause**: Missing user/professional in beforeEach

#### files.router.test.ts (8 failures)

All failing with status 500 (expected 201/400/401):

1. ❌ should upload file successfully
2. ❌ should reject when no file is provided
3. ❌ should reject when file_type is not provided
4. ❌ should handle upload with upload_code validation - **Error**: updateMany does not exist on mock
5. ❌ should reject invalid upload_code
6. ❌ should upload file by code successfully - **Error**: spyOn could not find upload_codes
7. ❌ should reject non-JPG files
8. ❌ should reject files larger than 2KB

**Root cause**: Tests use mocks instead of real Prisma, but mocks are incomplete/incorrect

#### integration/files.router.integration.test.ts (5 failures)

1. ❌ should return files for an event - Empty array (expected 1 file)
2. ❌ should upload file successfully - Status 400 (expected 201)
3. ❌ should return file content - **Error**: Foreign key violation in createTestEvent
4. ❌ should mark file as viewed - viewed_at is null (expected truthy)
5. ❌ should delete file - Status 404 (expected 200)

**Root cause**: Helper function createTestEvent has foreign key violations

## 🔧 Changes Made This Session

### 1. **Fixed Multer Error Handling** ✅

**File**: `apps/api/src/app/createApp.ts`

**Problem**: Multer errors (LIMIT_FILE_SIZE, fileFilter) were returning 500 instead of 400

**Solution**: Added specific error handling in global error middleware:

```javascript
// Tratamento específico para erros do multer
if (err && err.name === "MulterError") {
  let message = err.message;
  if (err.code === "LIMIT_FILE_SIZE") {
    message = "File too large";
  }
  return res.status(400).json({ message });
}

// Tratamento específico para erros do fileFilter do multer
if (
  err &&
  err.message &&
  err.message.includes("Apenas arquivos do tipo imagem são permitidos")
) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: err.message });
}
```

**Impact**: Fixed 2 tests in external.router.test.ts

### 2. **Corrected external.router.test.ts** (3/7 → 4/7) ✅

**File**: `tests/routes/external.router.test.ts`

**Changes**:

- ✅ Fixed notification assertion - Expected "enviou 1 arquivo(s)" (new event) instead of "novos arquivos" (existing event)
- ✅ Fixed 404 test - Added file attachment to pass multer validation before checking user
- ✅ Fixed non-image test - Added proper contentType header:
  ```javascript
  .attach('file_requisicao', Buffer.from('text content'), {
    filename: 'test.txt',
    contentType: 'text/plain'
  })
  ```
- ✅ Fixed file too large test - Added contentType for PNG

**Result**: 4/7 passing (was 3/7), gained +1 test

### 3. **Previous Session Fixes** (Already Applied)

- ✅ files.behavior.test.ts - Real bcrypt hash for 'validcode'
- ✅ sharing.behavior.test.ts - Fixed mock to 3 queries
- ✅ files.service.test.ts - MOCK_USER_ID consistency
- ✅ events.service.test.ts - Updated function count to 6

---

## 🎯 Next Steps to Reach 90% (Need +8 tests)

### Priority 1: Fix external.router.test.ts (3 tests) - **BLOCKER**

**Issue**: Foreign key violations when creating professionals

**Investigation needed**:

1. Check why tx.professionals.create is failing
2. Verify user_id exists in transaction context
3. Ensure beforeEach cleanup is working properly

**Expected gain**: +3 tests (would be 65/78 = 83%)

### Priority 2: Fix integration tests (5 tests) - **MEDIUM**

**Issue**: createTestEvent helper has foreign key violations

**Solution**:

1. Fix createTestEvent to properly create user first
2. Ensure proper cleanup order in beforeEach/afterEach
3. Verify all foreign keys are satisfied

**Expected gain**: +5 tests (would be 70/78 = 90%) ✅ **GOAL REACHED**

### Priority 3: Refactor files.router.test.ts (8 tests) - **LOW PRIORITY**

**Issue**: Tests use incomplete mocks instead of real Prisma

**Solution**: Convert to integration tests like external.router.test.ts

- Remove mocks
- Use real Prisma with proper cleanup
- Create real test data

**Expected gain**: +8 tests (would be 78/78 = 100%) 🎯

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Foreign Key Violations**

   - external.router.test.ts line 98: professionals.create
   - external.router.test.ts line 265: events.create
   - integration tests: createTestEvent helper

2. **Incomplete Mocks**

   - files.router.test.ts: mockPrisma missing upload_codes
   - files.router.test.ts: mockPrisma.events missing updateMany

3. **Test Data Issues**
   - integration tests: files not being created/found
   - viewed_at not being updated

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Multer errors happen BEFORE route handlers** - Need global error middleware
2. **Real Prisma > Mocks** - Integration tests more reliable than mocks
3. **Foreign keys are strict** - Must create dependencies in correct order
4. **Bcrypt mocks don't work** - Better to use real hashes in tests
5. **Count ALL database queries** - Mocks must match exact query count

---

## 📝 Notes

- All service tests (46) are stable at 100%
- All middleware tests (3) are stable at 100%
- Behavior tests (13) are stable after bcrypt fix
- Main issues are in route/integration tests due to:
  - Foreign key constraints
  - Incomplete test data setup
  - Mock incompleteness

**Recommendation**: Focus on fixing foreign key issues in external.router and integration tests to reach 90% goal. Files.router refactor can wait.
